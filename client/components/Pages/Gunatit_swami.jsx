        According to Lord Swaminarayan’s boon, “I shall grace this planet
        perpetually through the God-Ordained Saint who is absolutely pious and
        has renounced the company of women, wealth and fame”, He blessed us with
        the legacy of saints who were and are the beacon of true faith and
        empathy in this fractured world. The first saint in this legacy of
        welfare promulgated by Lord Swaminarayan was Anadi Mool Akshar Moorti
        Shri Gunatitanand Swami. He was the incarnation of Brahm and Lord
        Swaminarayan was the embodiment of Parbhram. He was the absolute sevak
        (aide) of the Lord. It was said that He moved when the Lord’s eyes
        moved. He was the lexicon of Lord’s wish. Physically, He was born in
        Bhadara, a tiny village on the banks of river Und on the auspicious day
        of Sharad-Poornima (autumn solstice Full moon) in the year 1785 A.D. He
        was initiated as a saint and was named Nirgunanand – the man unbound by
        the three physical bodies. He was also named as Gunatitanand Swami – man
        beyond the boundaries of material world and virtues. Essentially,
        Nirgunanand and Gunatitanand signify the same meaning. He was the
        embodiment of service and devotion, the crucial points to gratify Lord
        Swaminarayan. He was not a mythical figure. He was the model for all the
        devotees who aspired to be the supreme sevak of the Lord. He strode this
        Earth propagating the divine message of Lord Swaminarayan. He was the
        first natural successor of Lord Swaminarayan.
