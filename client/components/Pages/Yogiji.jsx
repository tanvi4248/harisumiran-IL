      <div className="container">
        Guruhari Yogiji Maharaj was born in Dhari in Saurastra. His name was
        Jinabhai and true to His name, He remained Jino (a little one)
        throughout His mortal life. He was the forth successor of the divine
        legacy of Lord Swaminarayan. At the very small age, when a child is not
        even aware of any rationalism, He used to serve the local temple in
        Dhari waking up at 4.00 AM in the morning. He started performing the
        temple routine at the age of seven. He would bathe the idols of Lord,
        apply sandalwood paste and perform Aarti like an experienced pujari. His
        devotion and servitude was not only exemplary, it was supremely saintly.
        He was the byword of sevakbhav (the model disciple of His spiritual
        master) and true unreserved compassion. He was initiated as sadhu and
        named Sadhu Gnanjivandas. He was the ultimate model of devotion and
        humility. Inspite being the head of the Akshar mandir, Gondal; He was
        found in Kitchen in the wee hours of morning, noon or night. Tolerance
        was the synonym and devotion was intrinsic. For Sadhu Gnanjivandasji,
        servitude was not the quality to be acquired but the manifestation.
        Insults were His eulogy and treated one as the offering from the Lord.
        Guruhari Shashtriji Maharaj, defining His unison with Yogiji Maharaj,
        often exclaimed, “Huun te Jogi Ane Jogi te Hun.” (I am Yogi and Yogi is
        Me) He populated the idea of ‘Samp, Suhradbhav and Ekta’ – the practical
        ideology of unity and universal brotherhood. He was an ever-smiling
        personality, the true replica of a mother without the malice of the
        substance world. He was the one who promulgated and promoted humility as
        an asset and modesty as virtue, the most important for an aspiring
        devotee. He was, one person who put the beliefs in devotion and service
        in the devotee through His idyllic behavior.
