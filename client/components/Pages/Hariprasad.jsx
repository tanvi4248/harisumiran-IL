        Prabhudasbhai (Swamiji’s name before sainthood) was born in Asoj, a
        small village near Baroda in Gujarat on May 23th 1934. He was brilliant
        in His studies and modest in acclaiming His achievement since His
        childhood. Prabhudasbhai was initiated as Sadhu by Guruhari Yogiji
        Maharaj on Sharadpoornima, 10th October 1965. While proffering diksha on
        His chosen devotee, Guruhari Yogiji Maharaj proclaimed, ‘This diksha is
        like the diksha proffered upon M.A.M. Gunatitanand Swami by Lord
        Swaminarayan in Dabhan (the place where M.A.M. Gunatitanand Swami was
        initiated into sainthood).’ These words, coming out of Yogiji’s divine
        mouth, were not mere eulogy. These words were futuristic and were spoken
        by a visionary. It showed the path which the prospect had to take in the
        future. True to this prophecy, Swamiji became the fifth spiritual
        successor of the legacy of Lord Swaminarayan. He resolutely followed the
        regimen of Guruhari Yogiji Maharaj’s volition. To streamline the
        resolution, He founded Yogi Divine Society. He toiled day and night to
        foster the principle of Atmiyata (Spiritual Affinity with one and all)
        which is just the other way to foster the principle of samp, suhradbhav
        and ekta. Swamiji has loved all. He is known as the most secular saint
        in the contemporary world. Swamiji identifies all with Yogiji Maharaj
        and that is the reason he is acclaimed as a universal saint who strives
        to cultivate humanity, devotion and harmony in an individual, in the
        society, in the nation and in the world. His dictum is, ‘O Lord! Whether
        the other person becomes Atmiya (spiritually harmonious) or not, please
        make me Atmiya, (spiritually harmonious)!’ meaning, a devotee
        irrespective of the surroundings, circumstances, nature, temperament has
        to be harmonious and devoted to His Lord and the spiritual master.
        Today, because of His divine prowess and sublime selfless love, there
        are thousands of youths whose lives are the model of true piety, devoid
        of vices. His magnanimity has led the communion to live the life in
        accordance to the set principles of Lord Swaminarayan and the saints
        without artificial persuasion. His life and work could be more justified
        when we navigate through the activities inspired by Him, carried out
        under the auspices of Yogi Divine Society.
