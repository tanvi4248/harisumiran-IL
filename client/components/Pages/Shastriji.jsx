        He propagated the dual form of worship of Shri Akshar Purushottam, the
        essence of Swaminarayan sect; the philosophy which had gone unnoticed
        among the followers ! Akshar Purushottam â€“ dual worship is a faith of
        devotion to God with His most trusted and preferred devotee, Akshar.
        This dual worship helps us to understand the intricacies of spirituality
        of pleasing Parbrahm with the help of Akshar. A pupil needs teacher to
        accomplish his academic goals. Similarly, any disciple needs Akshar as
        his guide to realize his spiritual goal. Born in Mahelav, a small town
        in Gujarat, India, His personality was effectual. His prowess was
        evident from His illustrious childhood. His deeds evidenced the devotion
        and spirituality that was unseen so far. With his servility, He pleased
        one and all. Anadi Mahamukta Bhagatji Maharaj was very much pleased with
        Him. That made Him the recipient of the intrinsic knowledge of Lord
        Swaminarayan and M.A.M. Gunatitanand Swami. He studied hard to
        compliment the knowledge He had received from Anadi Mahamukta Bhagatji
        Maharaj. He was initiated as a Sadhu and named Yagnapurushdas. His
        dexterity was second to none in saintliness and learning. He became
        Shashtri in Sanskrit Scriptures; the degree that earned Him the
        nickname, Shashtriji Maharaj. He experienced contemptuous behaviour from
        the society. Undeterred in His persuasion of establishing the worship of
        dual nature as propounded by Lord Swaminarayan, He built five temples
        through which he spread this message of devotion to Shri Akshar
        Purushottam Maharaj. These five temples are the pinnacles of
        accomplishments in the history of Shri Akshar Purushottam worship. At
        the end of His mortal life, He indicated Guruhari Yogiji Maharaj as His
        successor, the manifestation of Aksharbrahm.
